# Magic-Mirror

The Magic Mirror is Raspberry Pi connected to a power source and a monitor behind a wooden frame with a two-way mirror.

The project was made for the reading of the temperature and humidity on different locations instead of doing that manually. I installed 4 NodeMCU boards coupled with DHT11 and DHT22 sensors along with another NodeMCU board with an RFID sensor.
The boards are sending the measurements with a http request to an Elastic Beanstalk PHP instance (AWS) which is saving the data to MySQL (AWS RDS). The information stored in the cloud can be read via a custom made Alexa skill which is parsing the JSONs generated by the PHP app, also can be checked accessing a webpage which displays the history of the measurements graphically and can be viewed on the Magic Mirror which is using the MMM-MysqlQuery module (cloned for every query)
